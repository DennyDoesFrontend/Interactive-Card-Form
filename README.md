## My process
This was quite the hefty project. 
Started off with the webpage using HTML and SCSS. Completed the desktop version and immediately started working on the javascript part of the project. Regular expressions posed a big problem for me especially when scripting the validation for the credit card. I had to use my research skills to find the regex for the credit card validation. The others worked quite well and soon I had it up and running. I added a little more responsiveness and made it more dynamic by updating the virtual credit cards as the user wrote in his/her details. After that, I coded the completion section and then worked on the responsiveness for mobile view. This challenge was indeed quite difficult and I learnt a lot on how to manipulate pages especially validation skills. This is annoyingly fun XD.
